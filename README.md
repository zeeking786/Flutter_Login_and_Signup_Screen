# Flutter_Login_and_Signup_Screen_UI

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

In this Project I have made the simple login and signup UI with basic validation and 
Pre-defined Username & Password .

It's easy and clear to use it and simple way of understanding .

```Username - admin```

```Password - admin@123```
